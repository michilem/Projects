Setup
    Fixed robot and goal post locations (robot centered at ~1m distance)
    The robot controls 5 states (hip roll angle) and 3 actions (in/out/kick)
    One additional, terminal state, not corresponding to a specific hip angle,
        is added to the state space.
    The goalie is static in one of 3 positions between the goal posts

Obtainable rewards
    Moving the leg in/out one step: -1
    Trying to move the leg in/out, when already at max in/out: -5
    Kicking the ball, but missing the goal: -20
    Kicking the ball and scoring a goal: 20

Plot
    The blue line shows the cumulative reward (per episode) over 20 episodes
    The red lines indicate a change in goalie position

Observations
    The robot perceives the goalie in the beginning of each episode
    The robot explores after negative reward is presented
    Once positive reward is presented, the robot exploits heavily and it is
        hard to return to an exploratory mode
    In the beginning of each new setup the reward is bad, but the robot learns
        quickly and avoids "extreme" leg positions
    Different goalie positions (and the corresponding behaviour) are learnt
        independently
    Uneven ground surface and slight variations in ball/robot setup sometimes
        influence the results

Future work
    Training for more episodes
    More fine-grained states (hip roll angles/goalie positions)
    Fine-tuning parameters (discount rate, reward values, exploration bonus)
    Code clean-up
